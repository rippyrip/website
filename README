You'll need Python and pipenv:

`pipenv install`

Then to see the site:

`pipenv run mkdocs serve`

You can then go to the site in your browser: http://localhost:8000
It will even auto-refresh when you make changes!

To publish:

`pipenv run mkdocs build`

This will render the site to plain HTML and put it all in the "site" folder
