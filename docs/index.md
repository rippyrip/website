# Welcome to irc.rippy.rip

Because even though the site is dead, the community lives on. A new IRC network valuing security and privacy. A place to catch up with old friends. A refuge.

## Features

* SSL-only – to guarantee that the people you are talking to are on SSL too
* Correctly-configured SSL for all hosts – no more accepting invalid certificates
* Full IP cloaks for all users by default – don't worry about your IP showing
* SASL authentication (including key-based for our most security-conscious users)

## Connecting

Connect to irc.rippy.rip on port 6697 with SSL ([more details](connecting.md)).
