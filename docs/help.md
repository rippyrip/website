## Trouble Connecting

If you are having trouble connecting, double-check you are [connecting to port 6697 and have enabled SSL](connecting.md). If the settings are definitely correct, check for updates for your IRC client â€“ if it's very old it probably can't speak the right version of SSL. Do _not_ disable certificate checking to try to make it work!
